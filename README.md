 A Discord bot for [Sleeping Knights server](https://sleepingknights.moe/) written in discord.js. It was originally written for just one purpose: To ask quizzes to users, and then assign specific roles based on the answers, kind of like the sorting hat in Harry Potter.
 
 It's still a work in progress, obviously.

 ### why watame?
 Because [Tsunomaki Watame](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqm3BQLlJfvkTsX_hvm0UmA) is just that cute and something [Shoukaku](https://github.com/Raphilia) liked when he started making this.
