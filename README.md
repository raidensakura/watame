A Discord bot for [Sleeping Knights server](https://sleepingknights.moe/) written using discord.js. It was originally made for just one purpose: To ask quizzes to users, and then assign specific roles based on the answers, kind of like the sorting hat in Harry Potter.

Quiz module is fully completed, but feel free to add feature suggestions or comments for QOL improvements!

## Why watame?
Because [Tsunomaki Watame](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqm3BQLlJfvkTsX_hvm0UmA) is just that cute and something [Shoukaku](https://github.com/Raphilia) liked when he started making this.
