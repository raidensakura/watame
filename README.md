A Discord bot for [Sleeping Knights server](https://sleepingknights.moe/) written using discord.js. It was originally made for just one purpose: To ask quizzes to users, and then assign specific roles based on the answers, kind of like the sorting hat in Harry Potter.

At the time of writing quiz module is fully tested and completed, but since I have free time to maintain this project, feature suggestions, bug reports and pull requests are welcomed.

## Why watame

Because [Tsunomaki Watame](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqm3BQLlJfvkTsX_hvm0UmA) is just that cute and something [Shoukaku](https://github.com/Raphilia) liked when he started making this.

## Self-hosting

While I try to make this bot as modular as possible, it's originally intended just to be run for my specific use case. You are free to join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/htn3D8p) and ask for self-hosting help, though keep in mind you may not get a response as we do not officially offer any support regarding this matter. Setup instructions are included only for debugging purposes.
